My solution for labs of MIT-6.004-computation-Construction spring 20.The materials of the course can be found here:https://6004.mit.edu/web/spring20/ As you konw,this lab is not open if you are not a MIT student, so that mean that you may not find some tools to hand those Labs, like Risc-v stimulator.And there are some my solutions for this Lab, if you have any questions, please email me at zhang.zx.1073538693@gmail.com.

## Lab 1&Lab b

Both labs are use Risc-v(Rv32I) to implement some code,but the question is if you are not MIT student,you will not have the permission to use there Risc-v stimulator.So I find a stimulator which is come from CS61C:https://venus.cs61c.org/
